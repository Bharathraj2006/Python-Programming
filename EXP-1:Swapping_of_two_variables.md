# EXP 1. 
## The boys Surya and Vijay had been playing switch and swap every time it suited their fancy since they had shared two balls. They had a temporary basket to drop the ball for swapping from each other. Write a python program to swap the colour of balls between Surya and Vijay.

## AIM:
To write a python program for swapping of two values

## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7

## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Get the two values from the user
### Step 2: 
Assign the value of second variable to a temporary variable 
### Step 3: 
Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable.
### Step 4:  
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable
### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be interchanged
### Step 6: 
End the program

## PROGRAM:

```
surya_ball = eval(input())
vijay_ball = eval(input())
basket = surya_ball 
surya_ball = vijay_ball 
vijay_ball =basket
print("Swapped values are:",surya_ball,vijay_ball )
```

## Output:
![output](https://github.com/Bharathraj2006/Python-Programming/assets/152376845/5d7a29f4-f247-459c-9e5c-2950b7a9491c)
